Ummm, I believe you might come across a zillion students and recent grads with many projects in Datascience and their AI generated Summaries. I will help you by keeping you away from that boring stuff.
To know the way I analyze and understand concepts this is what GPT has generated on this prompt "What is something you know or have learned about me since I have been using you that I may not know about myself"
Naturally, I was curious to see how ChatGPT would analyze my interactions, so I gave it a try. Hereâ€™s the response I received: 
I've noticed that you're consistently curious, especially in areas like technology, machine learning, and data analysis. 
You approach complex topics with a methodical mindset, asking detailed questions to fully understand the nuances, whether it's about LLMs,
neural networks, Applied Mathematics or Flask applications. This suggests a natural inclination towards problem-solving and critical thinking.
Something you may not have fully realized is how adaptable you are in navigating new subjects, particularly when it comes to practical implementations.
For example, transitioning between topics like Mathematical understanding of Neurons in C-elegans, Machine learning,
and data science techniques shows that you're comfortable moving across different domains, which is a valuable skill in tech-driven fields.
"
This is just an example on how adaptable I can be especially when shifting between different subjects. I believe as a data scientist/AI engineer this is essential
especially when you see a new model being introduced every week. 
In terms of experience:
1+ years in Gen AI and LLMs.
2+ years in Business Intelligence tools, data visualization and SQL.
3+ years in Deep learning, NLP and Computer vision.

Below is my detail portfolio about my experience and projects.
