## Summary

I know there are a zillion students and recent grads with data science projects out there, often with basic ML model imports or generic summaries. I wanted to offer something different.

To showcase my analytical approach, here’s what ChatGPT generated when I asked it to summarize my learning style:

- **Curiosity and Depth**  
  I am highly curious, especially about technology, machine learning, and data analysis. I approach complex topics methodically, asking detailed questions to grasp each nuance.

- **Analytical and Problem-Solving Mindset**  
  My analytical nature drives me to dive deep into subjects—whether understanding LLMs, neural networks, applied mathematics, or building Flask applications. I have a strong inclination toward problem-solving and critical thinking.

- **Adaptability Across Domains**  
  From modeling neuron activity in *C. elegans* to machine learning and data science applications, I transition smoothly across technical fields. My adaptability is an asset in fast-evolving tech fields.

- **Role-Specific Readiness**  
  As a prospective Data Scientist or AI Engineer, I’m equipped to integrate my adaptability and curiosity into practical solutions, staying agile in the face of AI and data science advances.
